      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item Built a pipeline to produce a computation graph from a program’s abstract syntax tree
        \item Designed and implemented automated sensitivity analysis methods for the purpose of model selection among multiple competing computation graphs of the same real-world phenomena
        \item Assembled a parallel corpus of Python functions with their respective PEP standard docstrings from common Python libraries
        \item Constructed a classification model capable of determining whether a given docstring matched a given source code function
        \item Currently creating a stylistic domain adaptation tool for encoder/decoder methods

      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item Developed an experimental framework to properly test the effectiveness of various machine learning classifiers with varying linguistic feature sets; classifiers trained to identify biological context and associate the context with biochemical reactions
        \item Researched and tuned several machine learning classifiers including Logistic regression, SVMs (with various kernels), random forests, deep neural networks, and a gradient boosted decision tree classifiers.
        \item Developed a parallelized experimentation suite to allow our experiments to be run on the U of A’s high-performance computing (HPC) cluster
        \item Developed visualizations of our classification results to aid in the explanation of our findings in our published manuscript
