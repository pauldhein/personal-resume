I am a software engineer with an MS in Computer Science and four years of experience developing software for data-intensive systems in both academic labs and industry.
As a software engineer who is passionate about reproducible science I am extremely enthusiastic to be applying for the position of Software Engineer II at the Allen Institute of Neural Dynamics.
I believe that my ——, ——, and —— will be beneficial to the Institute as it seeks to accomplish its mission to create the best-in-class open, reproducible, and scalable platform for scientific data storage, analysis, and sharing.
